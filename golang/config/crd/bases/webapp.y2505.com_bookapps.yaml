                      This field follows standard Kubernetes label syntax.
                      Valid values are either:

                      * Kubernetes-defined prefixed names:
                        * 'kubernetes.io/h2c' - HTTP/2 prior knowledge over cleartext as described in https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9113.html#name-starting-http-2-with-prior-

                      * Other protocols should use implementation-defined prefixed names such as

                      All ports within a ServiceSpec must have unique names. When considering
                      the endpoints for a Service, this must match the 'name' field in the
                      EndpointPort.

                      specified, in-range, and not in use it will be used, otherwise the
                      operation will fail.  If not specified, a port will be allocated if this
                      Service requires one.  If this field is specified when creating a
                      Service which does not need it, creation will fail. This field will be
                      wiped when updating a Service to no longer need it (e.g. changing type
                      from NodePort to ClusterIP).
